# FCFS_Tasks
C program that calculates the average waiting time and turnaround time for a predefined set of tasks using the First Come, First Served (FCFS) scheduling algorithm (non-preemptive). The program reads task information from a file named sample_in_schedule.txt and performs the scheduling based on the order of arrival.
